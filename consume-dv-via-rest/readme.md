# Consuming Data Virtuality via the built-in REST API

[Watch the presentation on Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/458569422/be4ab9d256)

List of files
- sql script for creation of sample views and procedures used during the session
- pdf version of the slides used during the session
- Postman collection of all sample requests during the session
- .rest file with all requests in one file (useful with VS Code + 'REST Client' extension)
- pdf about how to configure HTTPS connections to the built-in web server


:warning: Please note that all requests have their proper credentials removed. The slides contain a statement you can use to create your authentication token. 

In the Postman collection, right-click on the collection -> edit -> tab *Authorization* -> enter your valid username + password. 

In the .rest file you can replace the <BasicToken> placeholder with your proper token.
